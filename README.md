# -Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Python

I recently completed a project on Twitter sentiment analysis for the Ukraine and Russia War using Python. The dataset I used for this task was downloaded from Kaggle, and it consisted of over 20,000 tweets related to the conflict between the two countries.

To begin my analysis, I cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by removing any irrelevant or duplicate tweets, as well as standardizing the text and removing any unnecessary symbols or characters.

Next, I used various Python libraries such as NLTK, pandas, and scikit-learn to perform various tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and vectorization of the tweets. I also applied various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and support vector machines to classify the tweets into positive, negative, and neutral categories.

Finally, I visualized the results using matplotlib and seaborn to generate various graphs and charts. This allowed me to gain insights into the overall sentiment of the tweets and how it has changed over time.

Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me and allowed me to improve my skills in data cleaning, preprocessing, and machine learning. I hope you find this project as interesting as I did, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to learn more about my process.
